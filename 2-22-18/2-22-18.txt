Typing practice on pre-work

JS Notes
	Arrays are objects!
	Learn to speak Javascript - make statements with code.
	
	parseInt(string, radix);
		Parses a string into numbers
		Stops at the first non-numeral character, even if there are numbers after it
		Radix is log to use
			Use 10 by default, but always specify a number

	for loops
		for(iterator,condition,addition(iteration))

	DOM - Document Object Model
		Javascript's representation of HTML
		Connects webpage to scripts
		Use document.propertyName()
			var varName = document.getElementById(IDNAME);
				Refernces the element with id IDNAME and assigns that reference to varName
			document.onkeyup = function(event) {
 			  userText.textContent = event.key;
			};

		CHECK OUT:
			.innerhtml
				var varName = document.getElementById(IDNAME)
			${} backtick
			string template literal
