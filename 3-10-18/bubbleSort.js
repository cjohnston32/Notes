/** Pseudocode and Notes
 * Bubble sort: A simple sorting algorithm that operates by
 *  1) Repeatedly stepping through the list
 *  2) Comparing neighboring pairs and swapping them if needed
 *  3) Passing through the list multiple times until no more swapping is needed
 *      The end condition is: Has any swapping has been done on this pass?
