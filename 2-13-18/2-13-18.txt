HTML Notes
	FOR HW: Put side-by-side elements in same parent element div
		Think of containers on your page - rectangular shapes
	Containers:
		The <div> element is the most basic container with the most general use
		<section> <nav> <header> <footer> etc
		<article>:
			Defines a self-contained article
	<span>:
		Used for storing multiple inline elements
		EX:
			<p>Some words<span color="blue>BLUE WORDS</span>other words.</p>
