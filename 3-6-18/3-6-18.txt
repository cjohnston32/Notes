CSS Notes

jQuery Notes
    jQuery is a library used widely to simply JS operations/functions that would otherwise require a lot of time and expertise
    To free up time for other more important work
    To include jQuery
        Use a downloaded jquery.js file
        Use a CDN from Google or Microsoft
            Preferred method, faster loading time
            Google: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    
    Syntax
        $(selector).action()
            $ sign used to access jQuery
            A selector to query(find) HTML element(s)
            A jQuery action to perform on the element(s)
            EXAMPLES:
                $(this).hide()
                    Hides the current element
                $("p").hide()
                    Hides all <p> elements
                $(".test").hide()
                    Hides all elements with class "test"
                $("#test").hide()

    Document Ready Event
        Put any jQuery code inside a document ready event
        Doing this prevents any jQuery code from running before the document has finished loading
        Two ways:
            $(function() {
                // jQuery methods go here!
            });
                    or
            $(document).ready(function(){
                // jQuery goes here!
            });

JS Notes
    To make a multi-dimensional array simply
        Make normal array
            var list = [1, 2, 3];
        Then make an array out of desired single dimensional arrays
            var multiList = [list, list, list];
            = [1, 2, 3]
            [1, 2, 3]
            [1, 2, 3]

    continue vs break (in loops)
        continue will continue on to the next part of the loop/condition
        break ends the loop process and gets you out
    
DOM
    All DOM elements are unique!
