GITHUB NOTES
When making a repository
	Use SSH to have files accessible only by keys
	HTTPS attaches files to Github account
Never put a repo inside another repo when cloning

Useful terminal commands
	>alias aliasName="programName.exe"
		Allows you to use aliasName to call a program instead of the programName
		Ex: alias open="explorer.exe"

Process for adding new files
	Add - Commit - Push
		>git add FILENAME
		>git commit
			In first line, write a less than 50 char title describing what is being commmitted
			Subsequent lines may be used for more detailed information
			To leave/save:
				1) Press esc to get into command mode
				2) Enter :wq
			Good to commit after a point where the code is working
		>git push
	Other useful git commands
		>git status
			Returns status of files in repository
		>git log
			Lists changes to repository
